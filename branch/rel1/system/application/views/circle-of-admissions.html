		<p align="left">This is the circle which represents all colleges which

		<p align="left"><a name="autonomy" id="autonomy"></a><span class="cut-off">Circle 2 - Autonomy</span></p>
		<p align="left"> Shows Autonomy of the circle which it surrounds. All the 
			Engineering Colleges of Maharashtra are either Autonomous or Managed by some 
			University.</p>
		<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
		<p align="left"><a name="aid" id="aid"></a><span class="cut-off">Circle 3 - Aid</span></p>
		<p align="left"> This circle shows the Aid status. As it surrounds circle 2, this 
		  means that both Autonomous and University-managed colleges can either be

		  number of colleges having either of the status.</p>

		<p align="left"> All colleges in-turn make sure that you are eligible for
