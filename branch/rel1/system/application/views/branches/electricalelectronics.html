<p><span class="cut-off">Energy and Electric Power</span><br />
  Power engineers deal  with energy generation by a variety of methods -- turbine, hydro, fuel cell,  solar, geothermal, and wind, for example. They also deal with electrical power  distribution from source to consumer and within factories, offices, hospitals,  laboratories, and they design electric motors and batteries. In industry, power  engineers are employed wherever electrical energy is used to manufacture or  produce an end product -- petrochemicals, pulp, paper, textiles, metals, and  rubber, for example. They are needed to design electrical distribution systems  and instrumentation and control systems for the safe, effective, efficient  operation of the production facilities. As the average age of the engineers in  this job area approaches the mid-to-late forties, companies will begin to hire  young engineers in large numbers. Jobs in these industries should be plentiful.<br />
  <span class="cut-off"><br />
    </span></p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Computers</span><br />
  The computer industry  serves many industry sectors, including aerospace, transportation,  construction, telecommunications, power, medicine, and automated manufacturing.  The industry is strong and growing, in part because of the desire of corporate  America to reduce its dependence on large, expensive centralized systems based  on mainframes, and instead to opt for more flexible architectures like  client/server networks, or private &quot;intranets&quot; based on Internet  technology, separated by a protective firewall to maintain local security for  proprietary materials. Even more compelling, individuals and companies alike  have embraced the World Wide Web as an information source, communication  medium, and market for goods, creating a seemingly insatiable demand for  advanced software, high-speed modems, and more powerful PCs. Many employers in  the computer industry find it difficult to fill the positions created by  growth. Demand is especially strong for those whose knowledge and skills  integrate hardware and software, as hardware/software codesign gains in  popularity. For more information visit:</p>

<p><span class="cut-off">Semiconductors</span><br />
  The chief enabling technology at the heart of the electronic components booming  computer industry is semiconductor technology, in particular the development  and manufacture of integrated circuits. As integrated circuits companies strive  to search for faster and more powerful chips, they seek engineers to  investigate new materials and improved packaging -- engineers who can handle  the challenge of competitive pressure and ever-shorter development time.  Manufacturers of microprocessors and memory chips for example, continuously  improve existing products and introduce new ones to beat the competition and meet  customers' expectations of ever-higher performance. Semiconductor products  include not just digital ICs but also analog chips, mixed-signal (analog and  digital) integrated circuits, and radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits.  Another important sector deals with power semiconductor devices for power  control in manufacturing, transportation, and electrical distribution. For more  information, visit:</p>

<p><span class="cut-off">Aerospace</span><br />
  Electrical and  electronics engineers in the aerospace field design and develop electronics and  power equipment for aircraft, helicopters, and spacecraft. Displays, controls,  communications, and navigation are important aspects of the field, as are  simulators for training and development. Military systems for land, sea, and  air also come under the aerospace category. Defense and aerospace companies  still employ hundreds of thousands of engineers, even though the aerospace  industry has faced some hard times in recent years. Prospects in the two major  branches of the industry are looking brighter. Commercial airlines are  regaining profitability, and R&amp;D for defense and space exploration will  continue at more sustainable and appropriate levels, given changes in world  politics and limited tax dollars. While defense systems are not a major  priority for the United    States anymore, interest in space  exploration and travel is reviving, and new satellites are needed to meet  swelling demand for global communications.

<p><span class="cut-off">Bioengineering</span><br />
  This wide-ranging  field, alternatively referred to as biomedical engineering, was created some 30  years ago by the merging interests of engineering and the biological /medical  sciences. Some of the representative bioengineering activities include the  design of diagnostic and therapeutic devices for clinical use, the design of  prosthetic devices, the development of biologically compatible materials, and  the application of state-of-the-art technology to biological research. This  field has grown tremendously since its inception; now more than 100  universities offer training programs that are funded by hundreds of millions of  dollars from government and private sectors.&nbsp; Bioengineering is an  interdisciplinary field with employers in many sectors. Bioengineers work with  other health care professionals as members of a team. The biomedical engineer  must learn to think of biology in new ways in order to develop new tools for  diagnosing disease and to repair or replace diseased organs. Many of the major  advances in this field now seem almost commonplace: pacemakers, blood  analyzers, cochlear implants, medical imaging, lasers, prosthetic implants, and  life support systems are just a few of the results of the team efforts of  biomedical engineers and health professionals. <br />

<p>Manufacturing<br />
  <img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/electrica4.jpg" alt="Electrical and Electronics Engineering" />
  
  Manufacturing technology has become more important in recent years as global  economic reality has forced companies to reevaluate basic manufacturing  techniques in order to remain competitive. In pursuit of increased  productivity, companies have introduced such innovations as just-in-time parts  supply, six-sigma quality goals, statistical process control, and robotic  assembly cells. Even small companies have transformed their ad hoc approach to  process development into rigidly controlled and monitored systems, well  understood in terms of mathematical models, where the effects of random events  can be quickly detected and corrected. Thus there is a widespread application  of the manufacturing sciences in the workplace today, from automation on the  production line to management techniques to environmentally friendly methods of  manufacturing.

<p><span class="cut-off">Services and Other Professions</span><br />
  Many electrical and computer engineers and computer scientists find that their  technical background makes them well suited for a variety of work in other  industries. For example, the service industry has become a major employer of  engineers and computer professionals. Some find work that directly corresponds  to their professional training. The entertainment industry hires engineers for  a variety of projects; Disney, for example, recruits imagineers to develop  amusement parks, while Pixar hires computer scientists/engineers to help create  animated films. The banking and finance industry has many computer-related  positions that need engineers to manage rapid-trading activities. Many  organizations use the talents of computer professionals to create, store, and  transmit data and to create and manage systems for operation. Although  individually these industries do not employ a large number of engineers, in  combination they add up to a large whole. Engineering majors can thus look to industries  where they can apply their technical knowledge and skills in fields that may  not be high-tech in themselves.<br />
  <br />
  </p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Education and Research</span><br />
  Many electrical engineers,  computer engineers, and computer scientists interact with educational and  research institutions or industrial labs. Some go straight into college and  university teaching and research after completing their PhD degrees. Others,  including those with master's degrees, may teach on a part-time basis while  holding a full-time job with another organization or as an independent  consultant. Still others teach for corporate universities instituted by  companies such as Motorola, Intel, and Bellcore. Opportunities also abound in  continuing professional education, such as short courses designed to update  engineers. Taught by faculty as well as consultants with industry experience,  these courses are offered to employees on site as well as off site. Engineers  with expertise in timely subjects can also give papers and publish articles and  books that bring them recognition and put them in line for consulting work.</p>
<p><br />
  <span class="cut-off"><br />
    Transportation and Automotive</span><br />
  This industry spans  many areas. Transportation can include railroads, shipbuilding, and traffic  management. What these disparate areas have in common is that employers rely on  increased use of electronics merged with other engineering disciplines. It  includes electronics for internal and external communication, navigation,  failure detection, and displays of many types. Many vehicles are directed and  accelerated by fault-tolerant electronics. Electric power is generated and  distributed within most vehicles. Ships are wired like small cities for power  and information. Once the domain of mechanical and civil engineering,  transportation and automotive areas have many job opportunities for electrical  engineers from various technical specialties, including communications,  computers, and control systems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Day In The  Life</span><br />
  Working as an engineer  is much different than training to be an engineer. Unlike school, there is no  typical day. The matrix of your job function, interactions with coworkers, type  of industry, and the culture of your company will govern your job satisfaction,  and it is important that you fully understand the parameters.</p>

<p><span class="cut-off">Working in Teams</span><br />
  In the working world it is the success of the team that counts. The team itself  may be formal with a designated leader and everyone with defined roles, or  loosely constructed and informal in nature. The team may be made up of several  people or just you and one other person. Often, teams draw from several  departments in an organization. You will encounter colleagues of diverse  backgrounds, temperaments, and levels of ability and education. It is up to you  to work successfully in the group. Tips:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Do not be afraid to       ask questions, especially those that help you define your       responsibilities.</li>
  <li>Solicit feedback       informally on progress checks, deadlines, and changes in procedures or       priorities.</li>
  <li>Be thorough but       don't lose pace with the project by getting lost in details.</li>
  <li>Voice your ideas       but develop sensitivity to when to press your point and when to let it go.</li>
  <li>Be receptive to       criticism, even if not given in a constructive manner.</li>
  <li>Keep a cool head       during disagreements. It will do more for you and your reputation than an       angry response.</li>
  <li>Check with the       team leader to determine if you can contribute more when your share of the       project is completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>There  are four growth steps needed to become an effective leader:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Learning to       assess one's own behavior and to give and receive feedback.</li>
  <li>Assessing the       behaviors of other team members and the team as a whole.</li>
  <li>Providing team       leadership to enhance team effectiveness and satisfaction.</li>
  <li>Learning to       assign tasks to teams, select team members, and facilitate team       activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Types of Engineering Responsibilities</span><br />
  The IEEE Career Path Survey provides a glimpse into the types of responsibility  reported by electrical engineers. They include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Engineering w/o       supervisory responsibility, 29%</li>
  <li>Project       management, 21%</li>
  <li>Departmental       management, 16%</li>
  <li>Corporate, division       or plant management, 9%</li>
  <li>Other, 9%</li>
  <li>Engineering staff       support, 8%</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Levels of Engineering Responsibilities</span><br />
  The U.S.  Department of Labor, the agency responsible for the administration and  enforcement of federal statutes covering the workplace, has categorized  engineering jobs in nine levels. These rankings have equivalents to government  and academic ratings. <a href="http://www.careercornerstone.org/eleceng/elecenglabjobrank.htm">Click  here</a> to read descriptions of the nine rankings.<br />
  Employment<br />
  According  to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, electrical and electronics engineers  hold about 291,000 jobs in the U.S.  This represents 19.4% of the 1.5 million jobs held by engineers in the U.S.&nbsp;  Almost every industry has a need to employ electrical engineers.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.careercornerstone.org/eleceng/elecengind.htm" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn about employment of electrical engineers by industry sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  </p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Primary Job Functions</span><br />
  There are hundreds of job titles which employers use to describe the job  functions and responsibilities relating to electrical and electronics engineering.  It is taken for granted that EE's draw heavily from mathematics. Industry job  titles are not necessarily consistent from one employer to the next. Job titles  often reflect a particular discipline or industry; for example, computer  engineers, aerospace engineers, control systems engineers, and bioengineers.  Titles also refer to the basic functions that engineers perform, such as  research, design, testing and evaluation, manufacturing and applications,  maintenance and field service. Often employers refer to a specific technical  specialization or technology, such as, &quot;Software and Signal Processing  Engineers for IBM / Microelectronics,&quot; to describe the kind of engineer  wanted. Some engineers have titles that are associated with other functions,  such as management, human resources, sales and law. A good way to ascertain  commonly used job titles is to scan company web sites and employment ads placed  in newspapers and other publications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Industries</span><br />
  According to a survey  of IEEE Spectrum readers, employment of EEs and computer scientists is  concentrated in a small number of Fortune 1000 companies. 37 percent worked in  computer or electronics firms. Of those, two thirds worked at 64 large computer  or electronics firms. The rest worked for 503 smaller companies. One of six  Spectrum readers was employed in the utilities industry. A smaller percentage  were employed in professional service providers, aerospace companies, diversified-service  companies, government, universities, and other sectors. Although these figures  are instructive for EEs, the employment breakdown of computer professionals,  many of them who are not EEs, is more widely distributed in all industry  sectors.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="cut-off">Career Path  Forecast</span><br />
  According to the U.S. Department  of Labor, <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/" target="_blank">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>,  electrical engineers are expected to have employment growth of 6 percent over  the projections decade of 2006-2016.&nbsp; This is slower than the average for  all occupations. <br />
  Although  strong demand for electrical devices -- including electric power generators,  wireless phone transmitters, high-density batteries, and navigation systems --  should spur job growth, international competition and the use of engineering  services performed in other countries will limit employment growth. Electrical  engineers working in firms providing engineering expertise and design services  to manufacturers should have better job prospects. <br />
  Electronics  engineers (not including computer engineers) are expected to have employment  growth of 4 percent during the projections decade, again, slower than the average  for all occupations. Growth is expected to be fastest in service-providing  industries -- particularly in firms that provide engineering and design  services. </p>
