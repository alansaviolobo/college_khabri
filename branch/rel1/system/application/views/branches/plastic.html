		<p>Polymer or Plastic Engineering is a field of engineering that encompasses the spectrum of materials types and how to use them in manufacturing. Materials span the range: polymers (plastics), semiconductors, and combinations of materials called composites. We live in a world that is both dependent upon and limited by materials. 
	    Everything we see and use is made of materials: cars, airplanes, computers, refrigerators, microwave ovens, TVs, dishes, silverware, athletic equipment of all types, DVDs, and biomedical devices such as replacement joints and limbs. All of these require materials specifically tailored for their application. </p>
		<p>Specific properties are required that result from carefully selecting the materials and from controlling the manufacturing processes used to convert the basic materials into the final engineered product. Exciting new product developments frequently are possible only through new materials and/or processing. 
		  New materials technologies developed through engineering and science will continue to make startling changes in our lives in the future, and people in materials science and engineering will continue to be key in these changes and advances. These engineers deal with the science and technology of producing materials that have properties and shapes suitable for practical use. 
		  Activities of these engineers range from primary materials production, including recycling, through the design and development of new materials to the reliable and economical manufacturing for the final product. </p>
		<p>Such activities are found commonly in industries such as aerospace, transportation, electronics, energy conversion, and biomedical systems. 
		  The future will bring ever-increasing challenges and opportunities for new materials and better processing. Materials are evolving faster today than at any time in history. New and improved materials are an "underpinning technology" - one which can stimulate innovation and product improvement. High quality products result from improved processing and more emphasis will be placed on reclaiming and recycling. For these many reasons, most surveys name the materials field as one of the careers with excellent future opportunities.</p>
		<p class="cut-off">The Field		  </p>		<img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/plastics1.jpg" alt="Plastics or Polymer Engineering" />
		<p>CD-ROMs, like everything around us, are made of materials. So are dessert plates, basketballs, car engines, cell phones, and MP3 players. Therefore the work done under the heading of Materials Science Engineering has an unprecedented impact on our quality of life. Although the field deals with materials, it encompasses an incredible diversity of topics and problems constituting the four elements of the field -- processing, structure, properties, and performance.</p>
		<div align="right">[ <a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">Top</a> ]</div>
		<p class="grey-context"> Materials</p>
		<p>History is measured by innovations in materials. Developments in metals like iron and bronze enabled advances in civilization thousands of years ago, a synergy which continues today in the fiber optics that have created the internet and in the development of biomaterials that mimic living tissue. As you explore the field it may be useful to become familiar with some generic categories of materials.</p>
		<p class="grey-context">Plastics</p>
		<p>Plastics, also known as polymers, are generally organic compounds based upon carbon and hydrogen. They are very large molecular structures. Usually they are low density and are not stable at high temperatures.		  </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Semiconductors</p>
		<p>Semiconductors have electrical properties intermediate between metallic conductors and ceramic insulators. Electrical properties are strongly dependent upon small amounts of impurities.</p>
		<p class="grey-context">Composites<img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/plastics2.jpg" alt="Plastics or Polymer Engineering" /></p>
		<p>Composites consist of more than one material type. Fiberglass, a combination of glass and a polymer, is an example. Concrete and plywood are other familiar composites. Many new combinations include ceramic fibers in metal or polymer matrix.		  </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Processing		  </p>
		<p>Processing refers to the way in which a material is achieved. Advances in technology have made it possible to create a material atomic layer by atomic layer. There are four general categories which may be useful to know: solidification processing, powder processing, deposition processing, and deformation processing.		  </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Solidification Processing		  </p>
		<p>Most metals are formed by creating an alloy in the molten state, where it is relatively easy to mix the components. This process is also utilized for glasses and some polymers. Once the proper temperature and composition have been achieved, the melt is cast. Castings can be divided into two types, depending on the subsequent processing steps. The first type is shape casting, which takes advantage of the fluidity of liquid metal to form complex shapes directly. Because of the complexity of their part geometries, these castings generally cannot be worked mechanically to a significant degree. Therefore any changes in microstructure or properties must either be achieved first during solidification or through subsequent heat treatments.		  </p>
		<div align="right">[ <a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">Top</a> ]</div>
		<p class="grey-context">Powder Processing		  <img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/plastics3.jpg" alt="Plastics or Polymer Engineering" /></p>
		<p>Powder processing involves consolidation, or packing, of particulate to form a `green body'. Densification follows, usually by sintering. There are two basic methods of consolidating powders: either dry powder can be compacted in a die, a process known as dry-pressing, or the particles can be suspended in a liquid and then filtered against the walls of a porous mold in a process known as slip-casting or filter pressing. Bulk ceramics are usually processed in powder form since their high melting points and low formability prohibit other types of processing. Metals and polymers can also be processed from powders.		  </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Deposition Processing		  </p>
		<p>Deposition processing modifies a surface chemically, usually by depositing a chemical vapor or ions onto a surface. It is used in semiconductor processing and for decorative or protective coatings. Vapor source methods require a vacuum to transport the gaseous source of atoms to the surface for deposition. Common vapor sources are thermal evaporation (similar to boiling water to create steam), sputtering (using energetic ions to bombard a source and create the gas state), or laser light (ablates, or removes, atoms from surface to create the gaseous state). Other sources use carrier media such as electrochemical mixtures (ions in a solution transported by an electrical field to the surface for depositions) or spray coating (ions or small particles transported by gases, liquids, and/or electrical field).		  </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Deformation Processing</p>
		<p>One of the most common processes is the deformation of a solid to create a desired shape. A large force is generally used to accomplish the deformation, and many techniques heat the material in order to reduce the force necessary to deform it. Sometimes a mold is used to define the shape. Forging, an old method that heated the metal and deformed the metal by hammer blows is still used today, albeit with multi-ton hammers. Rolling to reduce the thickness of a plate is another common process. Some glasses when heated can be formed with tools or molds. Other common methods, like drilling to make holes, or milling, are machining versions of the deformation process.		  </p>
		<div align="right">[ <a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">Top</a> ]</div>
		<p class="grey-context">Structure		  </p>
		<p>Structure refers to the arrangement of a material's components from an atomic to a macro scale. Understanding the structure of a substance is key to understanding the state or condition of a material, information which is then correlated with the processing of the material in tandem with its properties. Understanding these relationships is an intrinsic part of materials science engineering, as it allows engineers to manipulate the properties of a material.</p>
		<p class="grey-context">Properties</p>
		<p>Does a material need to be strong and heat-resistant, yet lightweight? Whether you're talking about a fork or the space shuttle, products have specific requirements which necessitate the use of materials with unique properties. Materials engineers must frequently reconcile the desired properties of a material with its structural state to ensure compatibility with its selected processing. Typical properties of interest may be classified into:
		  Mechanical Properties: Tensile strength, fracture toughness, fatigue strength, creep strength, hardness
		  Electrical Properties: Conductivity or resistivity, ionic conductivity, semiconductor conductivity (mobility of holes and electrons)
		  Magnetic Properties: Magnetic susceptibility, Curie Temperature, Neel Temperature, saturation magnetization
		  Optical and Dielectric Properties: Polarization, capacitance, permittivity, refractive index, absorption
		  Thermal Properties: Coefficient of thermal expansion, heat capacity, thermal conductivity
		  Environmental Related Properties: Corrosion behavior, wear behavior		  </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Performance<img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/plastics4.jpg" alt="Plastics or Polymer Engineering" /></p>
		<p>The evaluation of performance is an integral part of the field. The analysis of failed products is often used to obtain feedback on processing and its control as well as to assist in the initial selection of the material and in the stages of processing. Testing also ensures that the product meets performance requirements. In many products the control of its processing is closely associated with some property test and/or a structural characterization.</p>

		<p>From cellular phones to artificial hip joints to lightweight bicycles, materials engineers work to develop products that improve lives. Materials engineers bring advances in the auto, aerospace, construction, manufacturing, electronics, computer, and telecommunications industries by developing new or improved metals, plastics, ceramics, semiconductors and composites. They work to increase the strength of steel, toughen ceramics, lower the cost of composites and make faster computer circuits. Materials are involved in almost every engineering product, and materials engineers are needed to select the best material, improve its properties, lower its processing cost and increase its durability.</p>
		<p align="right">[ <a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">Top</a> ]</p>
		<p class="grey-context">Career Tracks &amp; Job Duties<span class="cutoff"><a name="JobDuties" id="JobDuties"></a></span></p>
		<p>There can be many tracks within a career. A materials engineer might begin in a technical area such as manufacturing or research and development, and then move into a management, sales, marketing, or a consulting role, depending on interest and ability.</p>
		<p align="right">[ <a href="javascript:scroll(0,0)">Top</a> ]</p>
		<p class="cut-off">Teamwork and Environment<span class="cutoff"><a name="TheWorkplace" id="TheWorkplace"></a><a name="Teams" id="Teams"></a></span></p>
		<p>In a manufacturing operation most tasks are conducted by cross-functional teams of people. Materials engineers are generally part of a support group integral to these teams for various functions -- from design concept through manufacturing processes to final product evaluations</p>
		<p class="grey-context">Skill</p>
		<p>In addition to the technical and problem-solving skills requisite for a career in the field, the so-called `soft skills' will play a significant role in your success. Leadership abilities, teamwork, communication skills, flexibility, goal orientation, as well as the capacity for organization, all figure prominently in a career.		  </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Alternatives </p>
		<p>Because of their training and skills, materials engineers make strong candidates for jobs not traditionally associated with engineering: sales, training, law, medicine, insurance, real estate, publishing, finance, technical service, and government.</p>
		<p class="grey-context">Diversity</p>
		<p>Opportunities exist for a wide range of people with a spectrum of backgrounds. A recent survey shows a changing distribution of people in the field over the past twenty years. Much of this change was the result of people becoming aware of the opportunities in the field. </p>
		<p class="grey-context">Organizational Size</p>
		<p>Each work environment is unique. Factors like a company's size may impact your career. Over half of the people polled in a recent survey of the field work in large companies (more than 1000 people). However, a growing number of materials engineers are finding positions in small companies.		  </p>
