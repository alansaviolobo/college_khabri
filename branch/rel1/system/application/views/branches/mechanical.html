		  <h1>Mechanical engineering</h1><br/>
		  <p>Mechanical engineering is one of the  largest, broadest, and oldest engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers use  the principles of energy, materials, and mechanics to design and manufacture  machines and devices of all types. They create the processes and systems that  drive technology and industry. <br />
            <br />
            The key characteristics of the profession are its breadth, flexibility, and  individuality. The career paths of mechanical engineers are largely determined  by individual choices, a decided advantage in a changing world.&nbsp; <br />
  Mechanics,  energy and heat, mathematics, engineering sciences, design and manufacturing  form the foundation of mechanical engineering. Mechanics includes fluids,  ranging from still water to hypersonic gases flowing around a space vehicle; it  involves the motion of anything from a particle to a machine or complex  structure.<br />
  Mechanical engineers  research, design, develop, manufacture, and test tools, engines, machines, and  other mechanical devices. They work on power-producing machines such as  electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam and gas turbines.  They also work on power-using machines such as refrigeration and  air-conditioning equipment, machine tools, material handling systems, elevators  and escalators, industrial production equipment, and robots used in  manufacturing. Mechanical engineers also design tools that other engineers need  for their work. In addition, mechanical engineers work in manufacturing or  agriculture production, maintenance, or technical sales; many become  administrators or managers.<br />

              Analysis, design, and synthesis are the key functions of mechanical engineers.  The question is often how devices and processes actually work. The first step  is to visualize what is happening and clearly state the problem. A mechanical  engineer will then use computer-based modeling, simulation, and visualization  techniques to test different solutions.<br />
            <br />
              Design is one of the most satisfying jobs for a mechanical engineer. To design  and build a new car, you must reckon with power, weight, size and shape,  materials, reliability, and safety. &quot;Synthesis&quot; is when you pull all  the factors together in a design that can be successfully manufactured. Design  problems are challenging because most are open-ended, without a single or best  answer. There is no best mousetrap -- just better ones.<br />
            <br />
            The field is notable  for emphasizing versatility. A mechanical engineering education is an excellent  foundation for work in other fields. Some mechanical engineers work on medical  problems, such as the mechanics of bones and joints, or the fluid dynamics of  the circulatory system. Mechanical engineers deal with economic issues, from  the cost of a single component, to the economic impact of a manufacturing  plant. M.E.'s can be found in sales, engineering management, and corporate  management. Versatility is a decided asset in a world that is undergoing  constant economic, political, industrial, and social change. Mechanical  engineers are educated and positioned, not only to adapt, but to define and  direct change.<br />
          The  diversity of the field of mechanical engineering is represented in the  following areas of involvement.</p>
		  <p><br />
            <span class="grey-context">Basic Engineering</span><br />
          Fundamentally,  mechanical engineers are involved with the mechanics of motion and the transfer  of energy from one form to another or one place to another. Mechanical  engineers design and build machines for industrial and consumer use --  virtually any machine you find, had a mechanical engineer involved with its  development and production. They design heating, ventilation, and air conditioning  systems to control the climate in homes, offices, and industrial plants, and  develop refrigeration systems for the food industry. Mechanical engineers also  design heat exchangers, key components in high-tech mechanical and electronic  computer equipment.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p><br />
            <span class="grey-context">Energy Conversion  </span><br />
		    We live in a world of dependent on the production and conversion of energy into  useful forms. Mechanical engineers are involved in all aspects of the  production and conversion of energy from one form to another. We design and  operate fossil fuel, hydroelectric, conventional, nuclear and cogeneration  power plants. We design and develop internal combustion engines for  automobiles, trucks and marine use and also for electrical power generation. <br />
	        <br />
            <span class="grey-context">Energy Resources  </span><br />
		    Mechanical engineers  are experts on the conversion and use of existing energy sources and in  developing the equipment needed to process and transport fuels . At the same  time, mechanical engineers are active in finding and developing new forms of  energy. In that effort, mechanical engineers deal with the production of energy  from alternate sources, such as solar, geothermal, and wind. </p>
		  <p><br />
            <span class="grey-context">Engineering     &amp; Technology Management</span><br />
		    Working in project teams is a way of life for mechanical engineers. Deciding  which projects to undertake and leading those projects to a successful  conclusion is the job of experienced engineers who move into management. On the  safety front, all projects involve safety issues. By its very nature mechanical  engineering involves the harnessing and channeling of the forces of nature,  forces which are often extremely powerful. Consider the contained  &quot;explosion&quot; that inflates an automobile air bag or the mechanical  forces involved in bringing an airplane load of people to a safe and comfortable  landing, or the safety and reliability of an elevator, a power plant, or an  incubator for pre-maturely born infants. </p>
		  <p><br />
            <span class="grey-context">Environment       &amp; Transportation</span><br />
		    Transportation is a  large and growing field for mechanical engineers. Existing modes of air and  surface transport require continuous improvement or replacement. Mechanical  engineers work at the cutting edge of these efforts. Wherever machines are made  or used, you will find mechanical engineers. They are instrumental in the  design, development and manufacturing of machines that transmit power. They are  also critically involved with the environmental impact and fuel efficiency of  the machines they develop and with any by-products of the fuels used to power  those machines.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p><br />
		    <span class="grey-context">Manufacturing</span><br />
		    In contemporary manufacturing companies, mechanical engineers play a key role  in the &quot;realization&quot; of products, working closely with other  engineers and specialists in corporate management, finance, marketing, and  packaging. Mechanical engineers design products, select materials and  processes, and convert them to finished products. They design and manufacture  machine tools -- literally the machines that make machines and design entire  manufacturing processes, aided by the latest technologies in automation and  robotics. Finally, the finished products are transported in equipment designed  by mechanical engineers. This is the largest area of employment for mechanical  engineers, especially when the process and textile industries are included. A  finished product requires the right materials, a viable plant and equipment,  and a manufacturing system. This all comes within the purview of mechanical,  manufacturing and industrial engineers. </p>
            <img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/mechanical2.jpg" alt="Mechanical Engineering" />
		    		  <p><br />
		    <span class="grey-context">Materials &amp; Structures</span><br />
		    In order to arrive at  the best design for a product, mechanical engineers use a wide variety of  metal, plastic, ceramic materials. They also use composites made up of more  than one type of material. Once designed, built and in service, elements like  pipeline welds and sections, gears and other drive-train elements may need  inspection for structural integrity or the effects of mechanical wear.  Non-Destructive Evaluation, as its name implies, allows mechanical engineers to  use X-ray, magnetic particle, ultrasound and other techniques to examine the  internal condition of structural and machine parts, without causing them to  fail or without removing them from service. This analysis is particularly  important in assuring the reliability and safety of pressure vessels and piping  systems.&nbsp; </p>
		  <p><br />
		    <span class="grey-context">Systems &amp; Design</span><br />
		    Most mechanical engineers work in the design and control of mechanical,  electromechanical and fluid power systems. As a mechanical engineer functioning  as a design engineer it is likely that you would be involved with one or more  technical specialties, for example: Robotic System Design; Computer Coordinated  Mechanisms; Expert Systems in Design; Computer-Aided Engineering; Geometric  Design; Design Optimization; Kinematics and Dynamics of Mechanisms; Cam  Design/Gear Design; Power Transmission; or Design of Machine Elements. Design  engineers take into account a truly wide number of factors in the course of  their work, such as: product performance, cost, safety, manufacturability, serviceability,  human factors, aesthetic appearance, durability, reliability, environmental  impact and recycleability.</p>
		  <p><br />
		    <span class="cut-off">Day in the  Life</span><br />
		    There is no typical  day for most mechanical engineers. Engineering projects are multi-disciplinary  organizational efforts often involving scores of people inside and outside the  company. Project life cycles call for different skills and people at different  times. The issues and challenges start-off numerous and evolve throughout the  project. It is difficult to characterize a typical day under these  circumstances. Laced within and among other activities is a great deal of  communication -- on the phone, via e-mail, in meetings, teleconferences, memos,  and reports. No engineer works alone. Engineering is a team sport. <br />
		    <br />
		    Some projects will turn over in a week, some in three months or a year, and  projects may run concurrently. Workload can change as a project advances or  encounters obstacles. Diversity and challenge are among the things that  mechanical engineers like about their work.<br />
	        <br />
		    <span class="grey-context">First Job &amp; Beyond </span><br />
		    What are you likely to be doing? In their first job, about half of today's  mechanical engineers have a primary focus on some form of design engineering  and three-quarters do some work in this area. Product, Systems, and Plant  Equipment Design are forms of design engineering. This can be a broadening  experience, for engineering designers often work in teams consisting of  engineers of different disciplines who work in design, production, testing,  sales and service, people with finance, legal and marketing backgrounds and  project and corporate management. The solution to a problem may require  learning new things in other fields, which can help to develop career options  that may not be apparent when you are just starting out. Some mechanical  engineers are surprised by the responsibilities that go with their first job.  No one expects you to know everything on Day One, but you will be expected to  learn by doing the job, improving and growing as you move forward. You won't be  doing this alone, for much of your work will involve interaction with managers  and members of your project team.<br />
	        <br />
            <span class="grey-context">No Cookbook Solution	        </span><br />
		    Your courses and  projects in mechanical engineering will introduce you to the ways of  engineering, but then experience intervenes. Out in the real world you will  find that it's not just a matter of applying a formula or theory. Most problems  simply don't have a &quot;cookbook&quot; solution, so you have to draw upon all  of your education and experience, and you will routinely have to learn new  things to solve a problem. This will be a challenge, but also is a great source  of satisfaction as you move forward.<br />
	        <span class="grey-context"><br />
            Satisfaction            </span><br />
	        Mechanical engineers enjoy making a contribution to improving the quality of  life. Whether it's improving the performance and safety of an automobile, or  the latest in medical diagnostic equipment or gas turbine engines, mechanical  engineers enjoy being part of the solution of an important problem. Finding  satisfaction in overcoming obstacles, whether they are technical, financial,  legal, or managerial is central to the engineering psyche. Many find  satisfaction in the variety of jobs that they do, the opportunities for travel  and meeting people, the completion of projects, and the knowledge that they've  done something that not everyone can do. For some it's simply the satisfaction  of seeing their designs in production, used, and enjoyed by people.<br />
	        <br />
	                    <img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/mechanical3.jpg" alt="Mechanical Engineering" />
            <span class="grey-context">Challenges	        </span><br />
		    Mechanical engineers  thrive on solving complex problems. These are not purely technical problems --  mechanical engineers deal with management requirements, unique customer needs,  budgetary and legal constraints, environmental and social issues, as well as  changes in technology. It is the mechanical engineers training in mathematics,  the sciences, engineering fundamentals, and computer applications that provides  the ability to anticipate and respond to change. For the working engineer, the  key is staying abreast of emerging technologies. <br />
	        <br />
            <span class="grey-context">Engineering  Means Business            </span><br />
	        Mechanical engineering and business are closely intertwined. Mechanical  engineers develop products and services to meet the customer needs and cost  objectives identified by corporate management. Mechanical engineers advise  financial and marketing managers on the feasibility of new initiatives, and  when all systems are &quot;go,&quot; they design and build the production facilities.  More important, but less obvious, are the thousands of engineering service  companies, many of which are large businesses. Business and management  occupations are major career options for mechanical engineers.</p>
		  <p><span class="cut-off"><br />
	      The Workplace </span><br />
		    Mechanical Engineers work in many different settings, most often as a matter of  choice and career planning. They differ in the type of workplace, the problems  to be solved, and work schedule. Some mechanical engineers work in the design  centers and headquarters facilities of high-tech companies, some prefer working  in the field, and some travel overseas to serve clients and to develop new  markets for products and services. There's a good chance that you won't spend  all your waking hours sitting at a workstation. </p>
		  <p><span class="cut-off"><br />
          Lab/Field Work
	        </span><br />
		    Early-career  mechanical engineers tend to spend more time doing testing lab and field work  than their more experienced colleagues. Essentially all of the engineers  surveyed spend some amount of time in these activities. Advances in computer  simulation technologies have dramatically effected the type and nature of  physical testing that is done. Data gathered during tests of products and  processes is not only done as a production quality control measure, but often  has the very important use of supplying information that is used to improve the  computer design tools used to simulate the much more complex &quot;real  world.&quot;</p>

		    <br />
		                <img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/mechanical4.jpg" alt="Mechanical Engineering" />
	        75% of graduates with 5 or 10 years of experience spend from 10% to 30% of  their time working on proposals. Students should look for opportunities within  the curriculum to develop this skill through coursework and projects.</p>
		  <p><span class="cut-off">Global  Engineering</span><br />
		    <br />
		    In a global economy  many employers compete for business overseas, have multinational operations,  and work through overseas partners. Product realization is often an  international team effort, in which a manufacturing company might design a  product in the U.S., modify  it for assembly in Europe, use overseas contractors and suppliers, or set up  and run a plant in Germany.  Even if you do not work overseas, it's entirely possible that you will someday  be dealing with international clients. Language skills could become an item on  your list of &quot;lifelong learning&quot; objectives. A number of U.S. engineering schools participate in exchange  programs with universities in the Americas,  Europe, Asia, Africa and beyond. Students who  participate in these programs find that language skills and international  experiences distinguish them from other engineering graduates and job  candidates. Later on, engineers with this background have a wider choice of  assignments.<br />
	        <br />
            <span class="cut-off">Diversity            </span><br />
	        Engineering continues  to diversify in terms of the gender, ethnicity, and national origins of  students and graduates entering the engineering workforce. Mechanical  engineering offers excellent opportunities for women and minority students who  want 21st century careers that are challenging, progressive, flexible, and  well-paying. <br />
	        </p>      <br />
		  <p><span class="cut-off">Professionalism</span><br />
      
	        Ethics and Professional Responsibility: Ethics are standards or rules that  govern your behavior in a given situation. That doesn't mean that the rules can  change with each situation -- they should stay the same. One indication of a  true profession is the existence of a code of ethics and a clear sense of  professional responsibility. For an engineer, an ethical &quot;situation&quot;  could be when you have to choose between doing what is best for the customer or  the public, or doing whatever is best for you -- they may not be the same. It  could be a situation where you have used someone else's ideas -- have you given  them credit or compensation? Or it could be a question of being qualified to do  a certain kind of work. Situations often come up in the design, development,  and manufacture of products. This is why questions of ethics, safety and  health, and reliability are built into the design projects you will do as a  mechanical engineering student.</p>
		  <p><br />
		    <span class="cut-off">Employment</span><br />
		    According to the U.S. Bureau of  Labor Statistics, mechanical engineers hold about 227,000 jobs. This represents  15.1% of the 1.5 million jobs held by engineers in the U.S. <br />
		    Mechanical  engineers are capable of working in a wide variety of industry sectors, and new  technologies will create industries that don't exist today. Your opportunities  are determined by education, your interests and attitudes, and the contacts  that you make. According to an ASME Career Path Survey, about half of  mechanical engineers were employed in the original equipment industries. The  next largest industry sector was non-manufacturing employers, followed by process  industries.</p>
		  <p><span class="cut-off"><br />
          Evaluating Employers
            </span><br />
                        <img align="right" src="{php}echo base_url(){/php}images/branches/mechanical5.jpg" alt="Mechanical Engineering" />
		    Remember that there are two parties in an employment relationship. When  preparing for any job search, write down what you expect from an employer and a  job. This may not be easy the first time, when you can't fall back on  experience. Setting money aside for a moment, here are five questions that  working engineers see as important:</p>
		  <ul type="disc">
            <li>Can I expect a       variety of assignments, and will those assignments provide `hands-on'       experience in interesting, worthwhile areas? Will these projects prepare       me for bigger and better things?</li>
		    <li>How much actual       responsibility will I have for the projects assigned to me? What kind of       team will I be assigned to, and what will be my role? </li>
		    <li>Will I get a       chance to broaden my experience by working in different areas of the       company? Does the company have rotational assignments? </li>
		    <li>Were the people       who I met during my interview energetic and enthusiastic about their jobs?       Was there anything about employee morale that didn't seem positive?</li>
		    <li>Is there support       for continuing education, through in-house training, graduate studies, or       other professional education programs?</li>
	      </ul>
		  <p><span class="cut-off">Job Search </span><br />
          About 60% of  mechanical engineering graduates say that they find jobs through their campus  placement office, while some conduct their own job search, particularly where  specialized interests are involved. You may be interested in a company that  doesn't do much campus recruiting, and some companies have simply cut back on  campus interviews -- you have to reach out to them. Contacts can be very  important in finding opportunities and getting interviews, so try to build  contacts through faculty, co-op jobs and internships, alumni, and professional  association student groups. A job search is like marketing a new product, where  you first determine who your customers (potential employers) are and what they  need. You may have to shape the product (you) to meet customer requirements.  Finally, you devise a marketing message and focus on the most appropriate  customers, or in this case, employers. Think of the things that most interest  you, target companies that do those things, be persistent, and follow through  on leads. Presenting yourself effectively is a big part of getting hired. Try  to anticipate what the employer's needs are, and what information you should  provide to address those needs. </p>
		  <p><br />
            <span class="cut-off">Career Path  Forecast  </span><br />
		    According to the U.S. Department  of Labor, <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>,  mechanical engineers are projected to have 4 percent employment growth over the  projections decade of 2006-2016, slower than the average for all occupations. <br />
This  is because total employment in manufacturing industries -- in which employment  of mechanical engineers is concentrated -- is expected to decline. Some new job  opportunities will be created due to emerging technologies in biotechnology,  materials science, and nanotechnology.  <br />
Additional  opportunities outside of mechanical engineering will exist because the skills  acquired through earning a degree in mechanical engineering often can be  applied in other engineering specialties.  &nbsp; </p>
