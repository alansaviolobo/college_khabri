						  		<p class="grey-context"><em>Some may deliriously  say, &quot;Mai mere Pitaji ka sapna poora karke rahoonga!&quot;. Others may find it cheesy. Some may do it purely for a reason to boost thier 'geekyness'. You've been always opening your stereo system, building websites, watching tech TV shows or proudly calling yourself a geek.</em></p>
								<p class="grey-context"><em>Engineering is serious business. You must have always heard the nusances and mind-twisting threats by other people, &quot;Engineering is tough! beware!&quot;, know that they have nothing better to do in life than to warn you. They either are showing off or don't know what Engineeing is. You have to understand that nothing is tough until you want it to be. </em></p>

						           	<p><span class="medium-text">Engineering education "exercises" your brain much the way weight-lifting or aerobics exercises your body and the results are remarkably similar. </span></p>
						           	<p><span class="medium-text">The only difference is that physical exercise improves your body, while mental exercise improves your mind. As your engineering studies progress, therefore, your abilities to solve problems and think critically will increasingly grow stronger.</span></p>
						           	<p><span class="medium-text">One of the most valued things about engineering education is that it develops logical thinking ability. It gives you a great deal of confidence in your ability to deal effectively with problems. And this is not limited to engineering problems. One can use the critical thinking and problem-solving skills developed through engineering education to take on such varied tasks as planning a vacation, searching for a job, dealing with my car breaking down in the desert, organizing a banquet to raise money, purchasing a new home. We are sure you also will come to value the role your engineering education plays in your intellectual growth. </span></p>

						           <p><span class="medium-text">What is "prestige"? The dictionary defines it as "the power to command admiration or esteem," usually derived from one's social status, achievements, or profession. Engineering, as both a field of study and a profession, confers prestige. You may have already experienced the prestige associated with an engineering degree. To non-engineering majors, engineering students are "the really smart, studious ones." Everyone knows that engineering study requires hard work, so people assume you must be a serious, highly capable student.</span></p>
