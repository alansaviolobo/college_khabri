		<p>Production engineers are involved with the process of manufacturing from planning to packaging of the finished product. They work with tools such as robots, programmable and numerical controllers, and vision system to fine tune assembly, packaging, and shipping facilities. They examine flow and the process of manufacturing, looking for ways to streamline production, improve turnaround, and reduce costs. Often, a manufacturing engineer will work with a prototype, usually created electronically with computers, to plan the final manufacturing process.</p>
		<p>In a globally competitive marketplace, it is the job of the Production engineer to figure out methods and systems to produce a product in an efficient, cost-effective way to provide a marketing edge for the final product.</p>

		<p>Production engineering graduates generally begin their careers working in teams with other engineers to design a process or production system for a phase of a manufacturing process.  With experience, they may work as a production engineer, focusing on integrating the different processes and parts needed to create a finished product. Some Production engineering graduates decide to focus on the overall system, and take a wide view of the process including supplies, distribution, cost control, resource management, and marketing. Throughout their work, Production engineers are concerned about creating a quality product that meets customer needs in an efficient and safe manner that is cost effective.</p>

		<p>Production engineers often work in teams. They will frequently meet with other engineers and others outside engineering to review the manufacturing process, goals, and current status.  Production engineers may be involved in workforce planning and use, work flow, and the design and space planning for the manufacturing process. They may be involved in product planning, providing input into original product design -- with an eye to what will be required to ultimately manufacture the product. Their expertise in production efficiency is helpful in product design, and packaging planning. Production engineers may work with suppliers and other vendors to develop and review part specification, pricing, and delivery planning. They will be involved in quality control, and meeting standards for the final product. They may also focus on planning production times, cost estimates, and marketing decisions.		  </p>

		<p>Production engineers usually work in teams with others, and may physically spend time in manufacturing facilities, or in an office setting.  They often visit manufacturing settings to review the progress of processes, equipment, and projects. Although most manufacturing engineers work approximately 40 hours per week, they often have to work nights and weekends to meet deadlines.		  </p>

		<p class="cut-off">Teams and Coworkers<span class="cutoff"><a name="Teams" id="Teams"></a></span></p>
		<p>Almost all jobs in engineering require some sort of interaction with coworkers. Whether they are working in a team situation, or just asking for advice, most engineers have to have the ability to communicate and work with other people. Engineers should be creative, inquisitive, analytical, and detail-oriented. They should be able to work as part of a team and to communicate well, both orally and in writing. Communication abilities are important because engineers often interact with specialists in a wide range of fields outside engineering.		  </p>

		<p>Production Engineers work on products from design to distribution.  They work in almost every industry and on a wide range of products from autos, to toys, to sports equipment, to food, to computer chips.  They may work in the electrical manufacturing industry, for example, which includes the manufacture of electrical components for the generation, control, and distribution of electrical energy.
		  They start with raw materials, determine the most efficient manufacturing system to create the product, evaluate staffing needs, project costs, and coordinate the entire manufacturing process. Production engineers incorporate their knowledge of current techniques and equipment into their work, including computer-aided design, robotics, statistical process control, and computer-integrated manufacturing systems.</p>

		<p>Manufacturers seeking to streamline costs and improve products are looking to Production engineers to enhance the manufacturing process.
		  As a result, the demand for Production engineers is strong in manufacturing centers across India. </p>
