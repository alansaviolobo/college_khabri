        <p>Mining engineers, including mining safety engineers, find, extract, and prepare coal, metals, and minerals for use by manufacturing industries and utilities. They design open-pit and underground mines, supervise the construction of mine shafts and tunnels in underground operations, and devise methods for transporting minerals to processing plants. Mining engineers are responsible for the safe, economical, and environmentally sound operation of mines. 
          Some mining engineers work with geologists and metallurgical engineers to locate and appraise new ore deposits. Others develop new mining equipment or direct mineral- processing operations that separate minerals from the dirt, rock, and other materials with which they are mixed.
          Mining engineers frequently specialize in the mining of one mineral or metal, such as coal or gold. With increased emphasis on protecting the environment, many mining engineers work to solve problems related to land reclamation and water and air pollution. 
          Mining safety engineers use their knowledge of mine design and practices to ensure the safety of workers and to comply with State and Federal safety regulations. They inspect walls and roof surfaces, monitor air quality, and examine mining equipment for compliance with safety practices.</p>

        <p>Mining engineers work on many different tasks, including designing either open-pit or underground mines.  Their duties may include supervising construction or coming up with transportation plans for the minerals, coal, or metals they extract. Some mining and geological engineers focus on safety issues, while others develop new advances in mining equipment that can either increase safety or production or both.  Some engineers will help improve separation processing systems for separating minerals from rocks, dirt or other materials in their raw state.  Others will assist in valuating a mining operation, to determine the likely profits from the facility and work in teams to determine measures for increasing profits while maintaining quality and safe operations.</p>

        <p>The type of job a mining engineer has will often determine how much they work inside or outside. Many mining engineers work to solve problems related to land reclamation and water and air pollution, which will cause them to visit sites for evaluation. While some desk work is likely, most mining engineers will spend a good deal of time on job sites. There are international travel opportunities for some mining engineers, as their expertise is needed on a global basis.  Some mining engineers work on a consulting basis, and may spend most of their time in an office.</p>

        <p class="cut-off">Teams and Coworkers<span class="cutoff"><a name="Teams" id="Teams"></a></span></p>
        <p>Almost all jobs in engineering require some sort of interaction with coworkers. For example, some mining engineers work with geologists and metallurgical engineers to locate and appraise new ore deposits. Whether they are working in a team situation, or just asking for advice, most engineers have to have the ability to communicate and work with other people. Engineers should be creative, inquisitive, analytical, and detail-oriented. They should be able to work as part of a team and to communicate well, both orally and in writing. Communication abilities are important because engineers often interact with specialists in a wide range of fields outside engineering.          </p>

        <p class="cut-off">Employment<span class="cutoff"><a name="Employment" id="Employment"></a></span></p>
        <p>While about 4 out of 10 mining engineers worked in the mining industry, over one-third worked in professional, scientific, and technical services firms, mostly providing consulting and other services to the mining industry. Most of the rest worked in State or Central  government.</p>
        <p>Mining engineers often are employed at the location of natural deposits, often near small communities. Those in research and development, management, consulting, or sales, however, often are located in metropolitan areas.</p>

        <p><span class="cut-off">Career Path Forecast<a name="CareerPathForecast" id="CareerPathForecast"></a></span></p>
        <p>This is about as fast as the average for all occupations. Strong growth in demand for minerals and increased use of mining engineers in the oil and gas extraction industry is expected to create good employment growth over the 2006-16 period. Furthermore, relatively few schools offer mining engineering programs, resulting in good job opportunities for graduates. The best opportunities may require frequent travel or even living overseas for extended periods of time. </p>
