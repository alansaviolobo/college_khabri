  		<h1>What kind of work do the Engineers do?</h1>
 	</div>
		<img src="images/what-do-the-engineers-do.jpg" />
  		<p class="style5">Another way to understand the engineering profession is to examine engineers from the perspective of the work they do or the job functions they perform. </p>
  		<p class="style5">For example, an electrical engineer could also be referred to as a design engineer, a test engineer, or a development engineer depending on the nature of his or her work.
    Following is a description of the nine main engineering job functions.</p>
      <ol class="style11">
        <li class="style11"> Analysis</li>
        <li class="style11"> Design</li>
        <li class="style11">Test</li>
        <li class="style11"> Development</li>
        <li class="style11">Sales</li>
        <li class="style11">Research</li>
        <li class="style11">Management</li>

                   <h2>Analysis</h2><img src="images/analytical-engg.jpg" alt="analytical engineer" />
                   <p><span class="style16">The <strong>analytical engineer</strong> is primarily involved in the mathematical modeling of physical problems. Using the principles of mathematics, physics, and engineering science and making extensive use of engineering applications software the analytical engineer plays a critical role in the initial stage of a design project, providing information and answers to questions that are easy and inexpensive to obtain. Once the project moves from the conceptual, theoretical stage to the actual fabrication and implementation stage, changes tend to be time-consuming and costly. </span></p>
            </div>
    	<div id="v-thin-line"><h2>Design</h2><img src="images/design-engg.jpg" alt="Design" />
          <p><span class="style16">The <strong>design engineer</strong> converts concepts and information into detailed plans and specifications that dictate the development and manufacture of a product. Recognizing that many designs are possible, the design engineer must consider such factors as production cost, availability of materials, ease of production, and performance requirements. Creativity and innovation, along with an analytic mind and attention to detail, are key qualifications for a design engineer. </span></p>
    		</div>
    		<div id="v-thin-line">
    			<h2>Testing</h2><img src="images/testing-engg.jpg" alt="Testing" />
    			<p><span class="style16">The <strong>test engineer</strong> is responsible for developing and conducting tests to verify that a selected design or new product meets all specifications. Depending on the product, tests may be required for such factors as structural integrity, performance, or reliability all of which must be performed under all expected environmental conditions. Test engineers also conduct quality control checks on existing products. </span></p>
    		</div>
            <div id="v-thin-line"><h2>Development</h2><img src="images/development-engg.jpg" alt="Development" />
                  <p><span class="style16">The <strong>development engineer</strong>, as the title indicates, is involved in the development of products, systems, or processes. The context in which such "development" occurs, however, can vary considerably. Working on a specific design project, the development engineer acts as a kind of "intermediary" between the design and test engineers. He helps the design engineer to formulate as many designs as possible that meet all specifications and accommodate any constraints. Once a design is selected, the development engineer oversees its fabrication usually in the form of a prototype or model. The results of his collaboration with the design engineer and subsequent supervision of the prototype's fabrication are bound to affect the kind and amount of testing the test engineer will then need to conduct.
In a more general context, the development engineer is instrumental in turning concepts into actual products or applying new knowledge to improve existing products. In this capacity, he is the "D" in "R&D," which, as you probably know, stands for the Research and Development arm of many companies. Here, the development engineer is responsible for determining how to actualize or apply what the researcher discovers in the laboratory, typically by designing, fabricating, and testing prototypes or experimental models.
</span></p>
    		</div>
            <div id="v-thin-line"> <h2>Sales</h2><img src="images/sales-engg.jpg" alt="Sales" />
           		 <p><span class="style16">The <strong>sales engineer</strong> is the liaison person between the company and the customer. In this role, the sales engineer must be technically proficient in order to understand the product itself and the customer's needs. That means she must be able to explain the product in detail: how it operates, what functions it can perform, and why it will satisfy the customer's requirements. She also needs to maintain a professional working relationship as long as the customer is using her company's products. She must be able to field questions about the product, explain its features to new users, and arrange prompt, quality service should the customer experience problems with the product. Obviously, along with solid technical knowledge, the sales engineer must possess strong communication skills and related "people" skills.</span></p>
            </div>
        
                <div id="v-thin-line">
                  <h2>Research</h2><img src="images/development-engg5.jpg" alt="Research" />
                                      <p><span class="style16">The work of the <strong>research engineer</strong> is not unlike that of a research scientist in that both are involved in the search for new knowledge. Where they differ is the purposes that motivate their work. Scientific researchers are generally interested in the new knowledge itself: what it teaches or uncovers about natural phenomena. Engineering researchers are interested in ways to apply the knowledge to engineering practices and principles. Research engineers thus explore mathematics, physics, chemistry and engineering sciences in search of answers or insights that will contribute to the advancement of engineering.
                    Given the nature and demands of their work, research engineers usually need to have an advanced degree in their field. Indeed, most positions available in engineering research require a Ph.D.
                    </span></p>
    			</div>
                    <div id="v-thin-line">
                      <h2>Management</h2><img src="images/management-engg.jpg" alt="Management" />
                      <p><span class="style16">If you are successful as an engineer and have strong leadership skills, within a few years of graduation you could very well move into management. Opportunities exist primarily in two areas: <strong>line management</strong> and <strong>project management</strong>. 
                In a company, the technical staff is generally grouped into an engineering "line organization." At the base of this "line" are units of ten to 15 engineers, who are managed by a <strong>unit supervisor</strong>. At the next level up the line, these units report to a group manager. This organizational line continues up to <strong>department managers</strong>, a <strong>chief engineer</strong> or <strong>engineering vice president</strong>, and finally the <strong>president</strong>.</span></p>
                      <p><span class="style16"> Often the president of a technical company is an engineer who worked his or her way up through the line organization. 
                        Project management is a little different, as the personnel are organized according to a specific project or assignment. At the head of each project is a project manager. For a small project, one manager is usually sufficient to oversee the entire project; for a larger project, the project manager is assisted by a professional staff, which can range from one to several hundred people. The overall responsibility of the project manager and staff is to see that the project is completed successfully, on time, and within budget. </span></p>

                    <div id="v-thin-line">
                      <h2>Consulting</h2><img src="images/consulting-engg.jpg" alt="Consulting" />
                      <p><span class="style16">The work of the <strong>consulting engineer</strong> differs from that of all other engineers in that a consulting engineer performs services for a client on a contractual basis. Some consulting engineers are self-employed, while others work for consulting firms that "hire out" their engineers to companies that either lack the expertise the consulting engineer can provide or want an outside evaluation of their organization's performance. Depending on the client's specific needs, the consulting engineer's work can vary considerably. Investigations and analyses; preplanning, design and design implementation; research and development; construction management; and recommendations regarding engineering-related problems are just a few examples. 
                The time a consulting engineer puts into each assignment also can vary. Sometimes the work can be done in a day; other times it can require weeks, months, or even years to complete. If the diversity of work and opportunity to travel catch your interest, a career in engineering consulting could be for you.
                </span></p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="v-thin-line">
                      <h2>Academia</h2><img src="images/academia-engg.jpg" alt="Academia" />
                      <p><span class="style16">The <strong>engineering professor</strong> has two primary areas of responsibility: teaching, research, and service. Teaching includes not only classroom instruction, but also course and curriculum development, laboratory development, and the supervision of student projects or theses. Research involves the pursuit of new knowledge, which is then disseminated throughout the professional engineering community by papers published in engineering journals, presentations at scholarly meetings, textbooks, and software. The M.E. / M.Tech degree in engineering is virtually mandatory to qualify for a full-time position on an engineering faculty at a four-year institution, while an B.E. degree is generally sufficient for a temporary teaching position.</span></p>
